The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the **[JSFiddle Hello World example][]**. Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can create an index.html file and include Vue with:

[JSFiddle Hello World example]: https://jsfiddle.net/chrisvfritz/50wL7mdz/

**Development Version:** 
<blockquote class="blockquote">
{% highlight html %}
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
</blockquote>

**Production Version:** 
<blockquote class="blockquote">
{% highlight html %}
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
</blockquote>

The **[Installation][]** page provides more options of installing Vue. Note: We do not recommend that beginners start with **```vue-cli```**, especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.

If you prefer something more interactive, you can also check out **[this tutorial series on Scrimba][]**, which gives you a mix of screencast and code playground that you can pause and play around with anytime.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
{% highlight html %}
<div id="app-2">
  <span v-bind:title="message">
    Hover your mouse over me for a few seconds
    to see my dynamically bound title!
  </span>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var app2 = new Vue({
  el: '#app-2',
  data: {
    message: 'You loaded this page on ' + new Date().toLocaleString()
  }
})
{% endhighlight %}
</blockquote>

The **```v-bind```** attribute you are seeing is called a directive. Directives are prefixed with **```v-```** to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, it is basically saying “keep this element’s **```title```** attribute up-to-date with the **```message```** property on the Vue instance.”

If you open up your JavaScript console again and enter **```app2.message = 'some new message'```**, you’ll once again see that the bound HTML - in this case the **```title```** attribute - has been updated.
