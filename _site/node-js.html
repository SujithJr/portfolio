As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, <strong>NodeJS</strong> is designed to build scalable network applications. 
<!--more-->
In the following “hello world” example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node will sleep.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to today’s more common concurrency model where OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.</p>
