<strong>PHP</strong>, which stands for <strong>“PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor”</strong> is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. 
<!--more-->
Its syntax draws upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. The main goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated web pages quickly, but you can do much more with PHP.</p>

<p>It is possible to use the <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">header()</code></strong> function to send an <em>“Authentication Required”</em> message to the client browser causing it to pop up a Username/Password input window. Once the user has filled in a username and a password, the URL containing the PHP script will be called again with the predefined variables <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">PHP_AUTH_USER</code></strong>, <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">PHP_AUTH_PW</code></strong>, and <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">AUTH_TYPE</code></strong> set to the user name, password and authentication type respectively. These predefined variables are found in the <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">$_SERVER</code></strong> array. Both “Basic” and “Digest” (since PHP 5.1.0) authentication methods are supported. See the <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">header()</code></strong> function for more information.</p>
