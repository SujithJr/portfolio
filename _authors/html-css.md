**HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language)** and **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** are two of the core technologies for building Web pages.

HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting,HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as **```<img />```** and **```<input />```** directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as **```<p>```** surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. 

HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to: 
  * Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
  * Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
  * Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc. 
  * Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents. 

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including **layout**, **colors**, and **fonts**. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device
